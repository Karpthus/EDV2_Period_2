    - Edge detection  attempt to emulate an ability present in HVS.

Edge detection is hard image processing problem.

- Most Edge detection solutions exhibit limited performance in the presence of images containing real-world scenes.
- It is common to precede tje edge detection stage with pre-processing operations such as noise reduction and illumination correction.

## Basic concept

Edge: is kind of a step dicmtions high contrast is needed.

second derrivative is the change of speed of the speed.

The first order derivative gives the information to find a edege

and the second derivative gives the wether is goes form high to low or low to high.

The zero crossing between its positive and negative peaks can be ised to lacre the center of thick edges
